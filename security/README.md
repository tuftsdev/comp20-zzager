The report has been completed and is available online via Github Pages (http://tuftsdev.github.io/comp20-zzager/security/).

I worked with Duc Nguyen to find security issues in our respective servers. I also got help and information from several online sources. These are cited in the report.

I spent approximately seven hours looking through Duc's code, testing different hacking methods, researching security, and writing up the report.
