This repository contains several of the assignments I completed for the Tufts University Web Programming course (Comp 20) taught by Ming Chow. These assignments served to demonstrate the many possible approaches to web programming as well as the challenges and opportunities. They demonstrate how my skills have developed throughout the course as well as the breadth of the course focus.

My favorite assignment was the "responsive" lab. While extremely simple, this was the first time I ever created a dynamic web page. Having only created two or three static websites using basic HTML and CSS I was really excited when I got the page to display each comic panel at the correct page size. This lab showed me early on how versatile and exciting, yet simple web programming can be.

This course has helped me to grow both in terms of my programming abilities and my general understanding of how the Internet (one of the most important technological systems in human history) works. Before the course I had dabbled in JavaScript and the Phaser game development framework, but had never used JS for web programming purposes. I also had no idea how my computer received content from websites. Now, I have experience creating websites from both front-end and server-side perspectives. I also am more fully aware of the work I need to do to increase my skills and knowledge. I feel like this course has set me up to be as good at web programming as I am willing to work for.

This course has taught me over and over again not to reinvent the wheel. Most problems that are encountered by web programming have probably been faced before by someone else. Navigating stack exchange and the many web programming-related blogs is a necessary skill. This semester I developed a web app to apply for a summer internship (http://zachzager.github.io/elevator/). While I developed the core algorithm, I relied on others for other aspects of the site. I used the Bootstrap framework for the site's styling. Bootstrap enabled me to easily beautify the site and make it dynamic. I also was able to find a simple way to allow users to upload a .txt file to the website on a stack exchange post. Another example of when I found the answer to my problem online was when I was developing my semester project for this class. I wanted to create a dynamic score bar to show which dining hall is the best of the day. I was able to piece together the answers to various questions asked online to create a solution. The score bar looks pretty sweet.

I have always been interested in design, but feel like I could use more of a knowledge base. I want to dive deeper into front end frameworks like AngularJS, ReactJS, and Jade. Learning more about these technologies will empower me to easily create beautiful websites. I want my websites to look professional and clean.
