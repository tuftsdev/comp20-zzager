Overview:

This program properly runs all elements of the assignment. It sends and receives GPS data on user locations and historic landmarks. It also properly calculates the distances between the user and people and landmarks. The program uses the Google Maps API to display all user information.


This assignment took me approximately 10 hours to complete.
