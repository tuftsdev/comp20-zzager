Comp 20 - Web Programming
Lab: My Old Kentucky Home

I implemented all elements of the assignment correctly. If I spent more time on this project, I would highlight every word as it is being sung to make the annotation even more karaoke-like.

I did not collaborate with anyone. I receieved help from the Mozilla Developer Network website's JavaScript documentation.

I spent approximately four hours on this assignment.
